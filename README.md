# Call It a Comeback (CIC)
A crypto with teeth—built on Solana to drag small businesses, charities, and dreamers back from the brink. With 100 billion tokens, our community votes weekly to pick a fighter, then hits them with cash and chaos to make waves. One coin, one shot, all guts.

How It Works
- **Nominate**: Bring a small biz, charity, or cause with a plan.
- **Vote**: CIC tokens are used to cast votes. The one with the most tokens wins, and coins go into a wallet.
- **Win**: CIC wallet + community muscle (marketing, skills) for the champ.
- **Solana-Powered**: Fast, cheap, scalable.

Get In the Ring
We’re forging this on GitHub and need a crew:
- **Blockchain Brains**: Solana pros to collab on code for the token and its workings.
- **Community Organizers**: X/Discord/telegram maestros to rally the mob.
- **Marketing Mucle**: Loudmouth to blast CIC everywhere.
- Most importantly enough people that want to make a change.

Fork it, file issues, it starts now. Message for any questions
