# Call It a Comeback (CIC) Voting System
CIC runs on community muscle—your tokens, your voice. With 100B CIC on Solana, we vote to fuel comebacks and steer the ship. Two systems, one mission.

## 1. Weekly Support Fund Voting
10B CIC (10%) is locked to back winners—10M CIC per week for ~19 years. Here’s how we pick ‘em:

- **Nominate**: Pitch a small biz, charity, or dreamer with a plan (e.g., “Need 10M CIC for equipment”).
- **Vetting**: Quick check—registered, legit, no pocket-lining. Community or mods greenlight it.
- **Vote**: 
  - Each nominee gets a Solana wallet.
  - Send CIC to your pick (min 100 CIC).
  - 7 days: Mon 00:00 UTC – Sun 23:59 UTC.
- **Win**: Most CIC takes 10M from the Support Fund. Losers’ votes refunded or rolled over (TBD) All votes go to winner wallet? Or Burned? TBD.
- **Transparency**: Wallets public—watch it unfold on Solana Explorer or X.

**Example**: 
- Bakery A: 5M CIC voted.
- Charity B: 8M CIC voted (winner).
- Smart contract sends 10M CIC to Charity B.

## 2. Community Decision Voting
10B CIC (10%) is yours to wield—marketing, partnerships, whatever you dream up. Quarterly showdown:

- **Propose**: Submit ideas (e.g., “5B CIC for a comeback docuseries”).
- **Vote**: 
  - Proposals get Solana wallets.
  - Stake CIC (min 1,000 CIC) to your fave.
  - 7-day window, every 3 months (e.g., Jan 1–7).
- **Win**: Top CIC haul gets up to 5B CIC that quarter. Rest refunded.
- **Execution**: Funds move to a tracked wallet—community watches every dime.

**Example**: 
- Proposal 1 (Marketing): 6B CIC (wins, capped at 5B).
- Proposal 2 (Partnerships): 3B CIC (refunded).
- 5B CIC goes to marketing.

## Tech
- **Solana**: SPL token + Rust smart contracts.
- **Cost**: ~$0.00025/vote—dirt cheap.
- **Live**: Real-time tallies via Solana’s speed.

## To Settle
- Refund vs. roll losing Support Fund votes?
- Mod team or pure community vetting?
- Add a “no winner” option if nominees flop?
- Standard winner bag or community decides by contribution?

Your CIC, your rules. Drop ideas in Issues—let’s rig this for the comeback kings.
