# Call It a Comeback (CIC) Voting System
CIC is community muscle in token form—100B CIC on Solana, built to back small businesses, charities, and dreamers. We vote with our wallets, and every CIC counts. Two systems: weekly winner takes all, and yearly leftovers get split.

## 1. Weekly Support Fund Voting
10B CIC (10%) is the war chest for comebacks. No fixed prize—every CIC you vote with goes straight to the winner.

- **Nominate**: Pitch a small biz, charity, or dreamer with a plan (e.g., “CIC for a food truck”).
- **Vetting**: Community or mods check it—registered, legit, no self-dealing.
- **Vote**: 
  - Each nominee gets a Solana wallet.
  - Send CIC to your pick (min 100 CIC).
  - 7 days: Mon 00:00 UTC – Sun 23:59 UTC.
- **Win**: All CIC sent to nominee wallets tallies up—winner takes every token cast that week, plus community hustle (marketing, skills).
- **Transparency**: Wallets public—track it on Solana Explorer or X.

**Example**: 
- Week 1: 
  - Bakery A: 3M CIC.
  - Charity B: 5M CIC (wins, gets 5M CIC).
- Week 2: 
  - Shop C: 8M CIC (wins, gets 8M CIC).
- Total CIC stays fluid—winners claim what’s thrown.

## 2. Yearly Leftover Split
Whatever’s left of the 10B Support Fund at year’s end (Dec 31) gets divvied among the year’s winners by community vote.

- **Pool**: 10B CIC minus all weekly winnings (e.g., 52 weeks at 5M avg = 260M CIC; leftover = 9.74B).
- **Propose**: Ideas to split it—equal shares, top 5 winners, weighted by vote haul, etc.
- **Vote**: 
  - Stake CIC (min 1,000 CIC) to a proposal wallet.
  - 7-day window: Jan 1–7.
- **Split**: Leftover CIC sent to winners’ wallets per the winning plan.
- **Cap**: No single winner gets >50% of leftovers (keeps it fair).

**Example**: 
- 2025: 300M CIC awarded across 52 winners.
- Leftover: 9.7B CIC.
- Vote: “Equal split” wins—each gets ~186M CIC.

## Tech
- **Solana**: SPL token + Rust smart contracts.
- **Cost**: ~$0.00025/vote—cheap as dirt.
- **Live**: Real-time wallet tallies—see who’s winning instantly.

## To Settle
- Refund losing votes mid-week if wallets change? (No—keeps it simple.)
- Mod team size for vetting—3? 5?
- Yearly split vote—add a “burn it” option?

Your CIC, your fight. Throw ideas in Issues—let’s make every comeback count.
