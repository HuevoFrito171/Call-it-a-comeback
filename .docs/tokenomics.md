# Call It a Comeback (CIC) Tokenomics
CIC is a Solana-powered token with a fixed **10 billion token supply**, built to rally a community around small businesses, charities, and dreamers clawing their way back. No minting, no fluff—just raw fuel for comebacks. Here’s the split:

## Total Supply
- **10,000,000,000 CIC** (10 billion)
- Fixed supply, launched on Solana via SPL standard.

## Allocation
| **Category**          | **Percentage** | **Tokens**        | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Liquidity Pool**    | 50%            | 5,000,000,000 CIC | Seed trading on Raydium (CIC/SOL or CIC/USDC) for value and reach.         |
| **Support Fund**      | 10%            | 1,000,000,000 CIC | Weekly payouts to winners—all votes cast go to the champ.                  |
| **Community Rewards** | 15%            | 1,500,000,000 CIC | Incentives for voting, nominating, hustling—vested over time.              |
| **Team**              | 15%            | 1,500,000,000 CIC | For the crew building this—vested 2–3 years to stay in the fight.          |
| **Community Decision**| 10%            | 1,000,000,000 CIC | Community votes on use—marketing, partnerships, or wild ideas.             |

## Details
1. **Liquidity Pool (50%)**
   - Locked into Raydium or similar DEX for 2–3 years (via Team Finance/Unicrypt).
   - Initial pairing: 5B CIC + equivalent SOL/USDC (e.g., $5K–$10K seed).
   - Goal: CIC trades strong, accessible to all.

2. **Support Fund (10%)**
   - Held in a wallet or smart contract.
   - Weekly payout: All CIC votes cast go to the winner—could be 1M or 10M, depends on turnout.
   - Yearly leftover: Split among winners by community vote (e.g., ~19M/week avg leaves plenty).

3. **Community Rewards (15%)**
   - Airdrops, staking, or tasks (e.g., “Nominate 3 projects, get 50 CIC”).
   - Vesting: 1–2 years to reward loyalty, not quick flips.
   - Goal: Keep the crowd swinging.

4. **Team (15%)**
   - Locked with vesting (e.g., 20% yearly over 5 years).
   - For devs, community leads, legal—aligned with the comeback mission.

5. **Community Decision (10%)**
   - Controlled by CIC holders via on-chain voting (e.g., Snapshot or custom contract).
   - Options: Marketing blitz, small biz partnerships, extra support fund juice—your call.
   - Tracked: Public wallet shows every move.

## Why It Works
- **10B Supply**: Big enough for impact, small enough for value—10 CIC votes feel real.
- **Fixed**: No inflation, no surprises—trust is king.
- **Balanced**: 50% liquid for trading, 25% for mission (support + rewards), 25% for builders/community.

## Open Questions
- Cap Community Rewards per wallet?
- Burn unused Support Fund tokens after a decade?
- Community Decision voting frequency—monthly? Quarterly?

This is our comeback blueprint. Fork it, tweak it, build it—let’s go.
