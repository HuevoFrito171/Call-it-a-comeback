Call It a Comeback – Community Guidelines

Welcome to the official Call It a Comeback repository — a decentralized, community-powered coin born from resilience, unity, and collective action.

This project is built on the belief that when systems fail the people, the people build their own systems. We're not just creating a coin — we're creating a movement. To keep this community strong, inclusive, and purpose-driven, we ask all contributors and participants to follow these guidelines.

## Our Core Values

- Community over corporations  
- Transparency over hype  
- Resilience over reliance  
- Contribution over competition  
- Respect over ego  

## Code of Conduct

1. Respect Everyone  
Treat all members of the community with dignity and respect — regardless of experience level, background, or opinion. Healthy debate is welcome; personal attacks are not.

2. No Hate, No Harassment  
Discrimination, hate speech, bullying, or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. We rise by lifting each other — not tearing each other down.

3. Keep It Constructive  
Whether it's code contributions, issue reports, or community feedback — be clear, kind, and constructive. If you raise a problem, help us work toward a solution.

4. No Scams, Shills, or Pump Tactics  
This is a community coin, not a playground for opportunists. Manipulative behavior, deceptive promotions, or pump-and-dump tactics go against everything we stand for.

5. Support Newcomers  
Everyone starts somewhere. Help others grow and learn — whether they're writing their first commit or joining their first community call.

6. Contribute With Integrity  
All contributions (code, docs, ideas, outreach) should serve the project and its people — not personal clout-chasing. Build with us, not above us.

7. Protect the Community  
Report malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or toxic behavior. The strength of this project lies in how we watch out for each other.

## Accountability Clause

Any individual who chooses to violate these guidelines will be left to the mercy of the coin community — whether that's being called out, voted out, or phased out.

This is a decentralized effort. Respect it — or be reminded that the community remembers everything.

## Final Word

We’re here to build something that outlasts trends and outgrows gatekeepers. If you’re here to help, you’re one of us. If you’re here to exploit — good luck.

Call it what you want. We call it a comeback.

Thank you for contributing and building a better future — together.
